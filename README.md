# jumble-solver-py

## Target:
You'll have to download a word list, and then take a word as user input (CLI is fine), and finally  return matching â€œsub-anagrams".
Make sure your program can find words that use a subset of the provided letters, as well as true anagrams that use every letter.

## Deliverables:
* A working Python program
* A link to the word list
* Clean, legible code
* Sufficient documentation and an complexity analysis
